This is the TNNT irc/twitter bot.  Code is based on Beholder of #hardfought

Currently the bot's name is Croesus, and it lives in the channel #tnnt on libera.
The bot reports on games being played in the tournament, including ascensions(wins), deaths(losses), and other significant game events.
It also reports on tournament scoreboard events, by monitoring for changes to a json file generated by the scoreboard generator.
